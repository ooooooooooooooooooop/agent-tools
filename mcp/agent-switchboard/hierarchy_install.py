    return f"""## Cost-aware model hierarchy

- The model selected for the main session is the brain. Never rewrite that user choice. The brain owns requirements, architecture, planning, decomposition, hard diagnosis, high-risk decisions, and final sign-off.
- Native-first routing order is mandatory: for same-vendor labour, use native subagents first. A Codex brain uses the managed `explorer` (`{reader}`/low) and `worker` (`{workhorse}`/medium); a Claude brain uses managed `Explore` (`{claude_roles.get('reader') or 'haiku'}`) and `economy-worker` (`{claude_roles.get('workhorse') or 'sonnet'}`/medium). Do not use Agent Switchboard to launch same-vendor labour unless the named native role is unavailable or fails to start, and record that fallback. The external Antigravity Flash lane below is a distinct allowed Switchboard use, not a native child agent.
- For non-trivial planning or a hard issue, the brain must obtain one opposite-vendor maximum-effort consultation: a Codex brain uses Claude `{claude_chain}` with runtime attestation; a Claude brain uses the live Codex frontier `{frontier}` at the highest available single-agent effort. On explicit availability/entitlement failure, use the next advertised frontier candidate and report the fallback.
- Capability tier outranks model version. Gemini Flash High is a useful, non-authoritative workhorse-level adviser; a higher version does not promote it above Sol/Fable or make its advice automatically authoritative. When Claude's `{claude_chain}` frontier chain is unavailable because of quota, reachability, entitlement, or another availability failure, a Codex brain should request a second opinion from the newest live Antigravity Flash High, label it degraded advisory fallback, and retain final judgment.
- Cross-vendor routing must enter through Agent Switchboard's MCP tools whenever Switchboard is registered. For Flash labour, the sender brain MUST call MCP `route_agent_task`; a request to use Flash "through CLI" means `surface="cli"` on that MCP call. The brain MUST NOT invoke `agy` in a shell or call `consult_antigravity` directly. Only the Switchboard backend may start `agy`; sender-side direct `agy` is prohibited.
- Codex, Claude, and Gemini brains should proactively consider the newest live Antigravity Gemini Flash High through Agent Switchboard as a fast, cheap external workhorse for bounded search, reading, extraction, summaries, drafting, low-risk implementation/tests from an approved plan, and independent parallel packages. Use `route_agent_task` with `target_agent="antigravity"`, `surface="cli"`, `target_model="gemini flash"`, `effort="high"`, the correct `task_kind`, and `mode="plan"` or `mode="accept-edits"` plus the required implementation envelope.
- Every Flash call is exactly one bounded work package. Never hand Flash an entire autonomous plan or let it select/continue to another package. For implementation, the sender must provide `work_package_id`, 1-5 exact `allowed_files`, explicit `acceptance_criteria`, and any package-specific `forbidden_actions`; Switchboard rejects an incomplete envelope.
- A Switchboard-launched Gemini Flash session is the non-authoritative worker for exactly its assigned envelope, never the brain or router. It must not dispatch agents, reinterpret the whole plan, or continue to another package.
- Switchboard must invoke its internal `agy` backend with the mandatory `--output-format json --json-schema` contract. Missing/malformed fields, scope violations, contradictory completion, ambiguity, failed checks, or unsupported intentional/by-design claims are failures to escalate, not answers to accept.
- Flash never receives `danger-full-access`, production SSH, live credentials, destructive operations, migrations, or live deployment. It may prepare bounded local changes and checks; the brain owns live deployment and approval.
- If `agy` or Flash is missing, quota-limited, times out, mismatches the requested model, or otherwise fails, fall back to the host's native cheap roles (Codex `explorer`/`worker`; Claude `Explore`/`economy-worker`) and record the fallback.
- Flash and native workers may run concurrently only on independent stages/packages. Read-only packages may run in parallel; writes run serially unless their files and state transitions are demonstrably isolated. The brain reviews evidence and actual diffs. A Flash completion is never acceptance: before dispatching another package, the brain independently inspects cited primary lines, the actual diff, and check output. Unsupported claims that a defect is intentional/by design keep the investigation open.
- Delegate when handoff is cheaper than direct work and verification is cheap: bulk reading/search/extraction/formatting to the native reader; routine writing, light implementation, tests, scripts, and reversible deployment steps from an approved plan to the native workhorse.
- Plans are portable across vendors. Every package states `Lane | mechanism | exact resolved model/effort | deliverable | verification | escalation`, where Lane is semantic (`brain`, `reader`, or `workhorse`). At execution start, resolve the semantic lane to the executing brain's current same-vendor native role and record the exact model/effort. Never follow an imported foreign-vendor labour model literally; re-resolve it for the current executor.
- Keep ambiguous architecture, security/auth/payment/data-loss/migration work, irreversible actions, and approval with the brain. Workers stop on ambiguity, plan deviation, high-risk scope, or a failed fix; the brain diagnoses before redelegating a deterministic remainder.
- A dirty worktree, same-session ownership, or deployment authority is not a blanket reason to keep reading, test execution, evidence gathering, documentation, or isolated mechanical edits on the brain. Retain only the specific overlapping write or high-risk state transition.
- Brain overrides are package-specific and use exactly `override: brain - <WP-ID>: <specific reason>`. Bare/global overrides are invalid. The first ten direct labour calls remain flexible; after that, the installed `PreToolUse` gate denies the next eligible read/search/evidence/test/documentation/mechanical call until a same-vendor managed cheap-role agent starts or the brain registers the exact package/reason using the gate-provided local `routing-override` command. Each native start or registered override opens the next bounded block; completed planning delegation never disables implementation enforcement. Registered overrides must appear with the same reason in the final audit.
- Brain-context ingress is capped by default at roughly 1-2k tokens (8,000 characters). Before a verification response enters brain context, request an explicit field projection and output cap. Oversized MCP evidence is quarantined outside context with its query and location; do not pull the whole artifact back into context.
- A claim is a decision premise when it being false would change the patch, risk classification, or release decision. The reader locates it; the brain adjudicates only the minimum primary evidence. Every brain-retained premise read states `premise | what changes if false | bounded primary evidence` before inspection. "Needs judgment" never justifies broad rereading.
- Readers return file:line evidence and distinguish observed facts from interpretation. The brain reviews actual diffs and verification output. Reads may run in parallel; writes are serial unless files are demonstrably independent.
- Background shell lifecycle is part of package completion: before claiming completion or returning, reconcile every Claude-managed background Bash/PowerShell/Monitor job started in that package by obtaining its terminal result or stopping it. Launching or detaching a job is never verification.
- Do not claim implementation complete without a `Routing audit` mapping every planned and unplanned package to its lane, mechanism, resolved model/effort, verification, and one receipt: `native:<agent-id>` for a host-attested completed managed subagent, `broker:<uuid>` for an Agent Switchboard call, or the structured per-package brain override. The audit must include `direct-brain-labour: reads=N | searches=N | evidence=N | tests=N | docs=N | other=N`; every nonzero category must appear in a package row as `direct=reads,searches,...`. Native lifecycle attests agent id/type/completion; its checksum-protected role file attests configured model/effort unless the runtime exposes stronger attestation. Never treat prose self-identification as proof; label unavailable runtime model attestation unverified.
